	  This is taken advantage of by uClibc's malloc(), and also by
	  ELF-FDPIC binfmt's brk and stack allocator.

	  Because of the obvious security issues, this option should only be
	  enabled on embedded devices where you control what is run in

	  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can

	  tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,

	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
	  modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
	  modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
	  where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
	  this).

	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
	  executables used across different architectures and operating
	  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
	  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including

	  For an unmodified text mapping of an ELF object, including just
	  the first page of the file in a core dump makes it possible to
	  identify the build ID bits in the file, without paying the i/o
	  cost and disk space to dump all the text.  However, versions of
	  GDB before 6.7 are confused by ELF core dump files in this format.

	  The core dump behavior can be controlled per process using
	  the /proc/PID/coredump_filter pseudo-file; this setting is

	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of

          To use binfmt_misc, you will need to mount it:
		mount binfmt_misc -t binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when

config SYN_COOKIES

	  users from being able to connect to your computer during an ongoing
	  attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can
	  operate from anywhere on the Internet.

	  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you
	  say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge
	  protocol known as "SYN cookies" to enable legitimate users to
	  continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There
	  is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software;
	  SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information
	  about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.

	  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is
	  likely to have been forged by the attacker; it is only reported as
	  an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not
	  be taken as absolute truth.

	  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the
	  server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn
	  them off.

	  If you say Y here, you can disable SYN cookies at run time by
	  saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies

	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
	  you say Y here.

	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
	  typically a caching proxy server.

	  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
	  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
	  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
	  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
	  configuration).

	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
	  these packages.

	  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
	  minus 40).

	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
	  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
	  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
	  packets:
	        1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	        2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	        3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
	  configuration like:

	  iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
	                 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

	  The IPVS connection hash table uses the chaining scheme to handle

	  reduce conflicts when there are hundreds of thousands of connections
	  in the hash table.

	  Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the
	  value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is
	  from 8 to 20, the default number is 12, which means the table size
	  is 4096. Don't input the number too small, otherwise you will lose
	  performance on it. You can adapt the table size yourself, according
	  to your virtual server application. It is good to set the table size
	  not far less than the number of connections per second multiplying
	  average lasting time of connection in the table.  For example, your
	  virtual server gets 200 connections per second, the connection lasts
	  for 200 seconds in average in the connection table, the table size
	  should be not far less than 200x200, it is good to set the table
	  size 32768 (2**15).

	  Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and
	  each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is
	  needed for your box.

	  You can overwrite this number setting conn_tab_bits module parameter

	  The full internal IPX network enables you to allocate sockets on

	  to 0 when binding a socket on the primary network. In this case the
	  socket is assigned the default node that has been given to the

	  internal IPX network the cross-forwarding of packets targeted at
	  'special' sockets to sockets listening on the primary network is
	  disabled. This might break existing applications, especially RIP/SAP

	---help---
	  When the kernel has several packets to send out over a network
	  device, it has to decide which ones to send first, which ones to
	  delay, and which ones to drop. This is the job of the queueing
	  disciplines, several different algorithms for how to do this
	  "fairly" have been proposed.

	  If you say N here, you will get the standard packet scheduler, which
	  is a FIFO (first come, first served). If you say Y here, you will be
	  able to choose from among several alternative algorithms which can
	  then be attached to different network devices. This is useful for
	  example if some of your network devices are real time devices that
	  need a certain minimum data flow rate, or if you need to limit the
	  maximum data flow rate for traffic which matches specified criteria.
	  This code is considered to be experimental.

	  To administer these schedulers, you'll need the user-level utilities
	  from the package iproute2+tc at <ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/net/ip-routing/>.
	  That package also contains some documentation; for more, check out
	  <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/iproute2>.

	  If you say Y here and to "/proc file system" below, you will be able

config AX25
	tristate "Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2 protocol"
	depends on HAMRADIO
	help
	  This is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur
	  radio. It is either used by itself for point-to-point links, or to
	  carry other protocols such as tcp/ip. To use it, you need a device
	  that connects your Linux box to your amateur radio. You can either
	  use a low speed TNC (a Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of
	  modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's
	  microphone input and speaker output) supporting the KISS protocol or
	  one of the various SCC cards that are supported by the generic Z8530
	  or the DMA SCC driver. Another option are the Baycom modem serial
	  and parallel port hacks or the sound card modem (supported by their
	  own drivers). If you say Y here, you also have to say Y to one of
	  those drivers.

	  Information about where to get supporting software for Linux amateur
	  radio as well as information about how to configure an AX.25 port is
	  contained in the AX25-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You might also want to
	  check out the file <file:Documentation/networking/ax25.txt> in the
	  kernel source. More information about digital amateur radio in

	  DAMA is a mechanism to prevent collisions when doing AX.25
	  networking. A DAMA server (called "master") accepts incoming traffic
	  from clients (called "slaves") and redistributes it to other slaves.
	  If you say Y here, your Linux box will act as a DAMA slave; this is
	  transparent in that you don't have to do any special DAMA
	  configuration. Linux cannot yet act as a DAMA server.  This option
	  only compiles DAMA slave support into the kernel.  It still needs to
	  be enabled at runtime.  For more about DAMA see

	---help---
	  KISS is a protocol used for the exchange of data between a computer
	  and a Terminal Node Controller (a small embedded system commonly
	  used for networking over AX.25 amateur radio connections; it
	  connects the computer's serial port with the radio's microphone
	  input and speaker output).

	  Although KISS is less advanced than the 6pack protocol, it has
	  the advantage that it is already supported by most modern TNCs
	  without the need for a firmware upgrade.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called mkiss.

config 6PACK
	tristate "Serial port 6PACK driver"

	  6pack is a transmission protocol for the data exchange between your
	  PC and your TNC (the Terminal Node Controller acts as a kind of
	  modem connecting your computer's serial port to your radio's
	  microphone input and speaker output). This protocol can be used as
	  an alternative to KISS for networking over AX.25 amateur radio
	  connections, but it has some extended functionality.

	  Note that this driver is still experimental and might cause
	  problems. For details about the features and the usage of the
	  driver, read <file:Documentation/networking/6pack.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called 6pack.

config BPQETHER

	help
	  AX.25 is the protocol used for computer communication over amateur
	  radio. If you say Y here, you will be able to send and receive AX.25
	  traffic over Ethernet (also called "BPQ AX.25"), which could be
	  useful if some other computer on your local network has a direct
	  amateur radio connection.

config DMASCC
	tristate "High-speed (DMA) SCC driver for AX.25"
	depends on ISA && AX25 && BROKEN_ON_SMP && ISA_DMA_API
	---help---
	  This is a driver for high-speed SCC boards, i.e. those supporting
	  DMA on one port. You usually use those boards to connect your
	  computer to an amateur radio modem (such as the WA4DSY 56kbps
	  modem), in order to send and receive AX.25 packet radio network
	  traffic.

	  Currently, this driver supports Ottawa PI/PI2, Paccomm/Gracilis
	  PackeTwin, and S5SCC/DMA boards. They are detected automatically.
	  If you have one of these cards, say Y here and read the AX25-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver can operate multiple boards simultaneously. If you
	  compile it as a module (by saying M instead of Y), it will be called
	  dmascc. If you don't pass any parameter to the driver, all
	  possible I/O addresses are probed. This could irritate other devices
	  that are currently not in use. You may specify the list of addresses
	  to be probed by "dmascc.io=addr1,addr2,..." (when compiled into the
	  kernel image) or "io=addr1,addr2,..." (when loaded as a module). The
	  network interfaces will be called dmascc0 and dmascc1 for the board
	  detected first, dmascc2 and dmascc3 for the second one, and so on.

	  Before you configure each interface with ifconfig, you MUST set
	  certain parameters, such as channel access timing, clock mode, and
	  DMA channel. This is accomplished with a small utility program,
	  dmascc_cfg, available at
	  <http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Ax25-tools>. Please be sure to
	  get at least version 1.27 of dmascc_cfg, as older versions will not
	  work with the current driver.

	  this, read <file:Documentation/networking/z8530drv.txt> and the
	  AX25-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Also make sure to say Y

	  Softing Gmbh CAN cards come with 1 or 2 physical busses.
	  Those cards typically use Dual Port RAM to communicate
	  with the host CPU. The interface is then identical for PCI
	  and PCMCIA cards. This driver operates on a platform device,
	  which has been created by softing_cs or softing_pci driver.
	  Warning:
	  The API of the card does not allow fine control per bus, but
	  controls the 2 busses on the card together.
	  As such, some actions (start/stop/busoff recovery) on 1 bus
	  must bring down the other bus too temporarily.

	  If you want to exchange bits of data (vCal, vCard) with a PDA, you

	---help---
	  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
	  when acting as a primary station.
	  Disabling this option will make latency over IrDA very bad. Enabling
	  this option will make the IrDA stack send more packet than strictly
	  necessary, thus reduce your battery life (but not that much).

	  Fast RR will make IrLAP send out a RR frame immediately when
	  receiving a frame if its own transmit queue is currently empty. This
	  will give a lot of speed improvement when receiving much data since
	  the secondary station will not have to wait the max. turn around
	  time (usually 500ms) before it is allowed to transmit the next time.
	  If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty, the primary will
	  start backing-off before sending another RR frame, waiting longer
	  each time until the back-off reaches the max. turn around time.

	  Bluetooth is low-cost, low-power, short-range wireless technology.
	  It was designed as a replacement for cables and other short-range
	  technologies like IrDA.  Bluetooth operates in personal area range
	  that typically extends up to 10 meters.  More information about
	  Bluetooth can be found at <http://www.bluetooth.com/>.

	  Linux Bluetooth subsystem consist of several layers:
	     Bluetooth Core (HCI device and connection manager, scheduler)
	     HCI Device drivers (Interface to the hardware)
	     SCO Module (SCO audio links)
	     L2CAP Module (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol)
	     RFCOMM Module (RFCOMM Protocol)  
	     BNEP Module (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol)

	     HIDP Module (Human Interface Device Protocol)

	  Say Y here to compile Bluetooth support into the kernel or say M to
	  compile it as module (bluetooth).

	  To use Linux Bluetooth subsystem, you will need several user-space
	  utilities like hciconfig and hcid.  These utilities and updates to
	  Bluetooth kernel modules are provided in the BlueZ packages.
	  For more information, see <http://www.bluez.org/>.

	  the directory specified by the EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR option, which is

	  On DiskOnChip devices shipped with the INFTL filesystem (Millennium

	  the BBT.  If this is a concern for you, leave this option disabled and

	  The downside of leaving this option disabled is that if bad blocks

	  could cause future problems.
	  Once you enable this option, new filesystems (INFTL or others, created
	  in Linux or other operating systems) will not use the reserved area.
	  The only reason not to enable this option is to prevent damage to
	  preexisting filesystems.

	  This parameter defines the maximum difference between the highest

	  of UBI devices. When this threshold is exceeded, UBI starts performing
	  wear leveling by means of moving data from eraseblock with low erase
	  counter to eraseblocks with high erase counter.

	  The default value should be OK for SLC NAND flashes, NOR flashes and
	  other flashes which have eraseblock life-cycle 100000 or more.
	  However, in case of MLC NAND flashes which typically have eraseblock

	  UBI uses these reserved physical eraseblocks to relocate the bad one.
	  This option specifies how many physical eraseblocks will be reserved

	  host's disk; this may cause problems if, for example, the User-Mode
	  Linux 'Virtual Machine' uses a journalling filesystem and the host
	  computer crashes.

          Synchronous operation (i.e. always writing data to the host's disk
          immediately) is configurable on a per-UBD basis by using a special
          kernel command line option.  Alternatively, you can say Y here to
          turn on synchronous operation by default for all block devices.

          If you're running a journalling file system (like reiserfs, for

	  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
	  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility, found in the
	  util-linux package, see
	  <ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>.

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in
	  a disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server.

	  There are several ways of encrypting disks. Some of these require
	  kernel patches. The vanilla kernel offers the cryptoloop option
	  and a Device Mapper target (which is superior, as it supports all
	  file systems). If you want to use the cryptoloop, say Y to both
	  LOOP and CRYPTOLOOP, and make sure you have a recent (version 2.12
	  or later) version of util-linux. Additionally, be aware that
	  the cryptoloop is not safe for storing journaled filesystems.

	  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
	  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called loop.

	  WARNING: This device is not safe for journaled file systems like
	  ext3 or Reiserfs. Please use the Device Mapper crypto module
	  instead, which can be configured to be on-disk compatible with the

	  DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It
	  is designed to serve as a building block for high availability
	  clusters and in this context, is a "drop-in" replacement for shared
	  storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.

	  Each minor device has a role, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'.
	  On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to
	  run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
	  the local 'lower level block device' and, across the network, to the
	  node with the device in 'secondary' state.  The secondary device
	  simply writes the data to its lower level block device.

	  DRBD can also be used in dual-Primary mode (device writable on both
	  nodes), which means it can exhibit shared disk semantics in a
	  shared-nothing cluster.  Needless to say, on top of dual-Primary
	  DRBD utilizing a cluster file system is necessary to maintain for
	  cache coherency.

	  If you want to use SCSI scanners, synthesizers or CD-writers or just
	  about anything having "SCSI" in its name other than hard disks,
	  CD-ROMs or tapes, say Y here. These won't be supported by the kernel
	  directly, so you need some additional software which knows how to
	  talk to these devices using the SCSI protocol:

	  For scanners, look at SANE (<http://www.sane-project.org/>). For CD
	  writer software look at Cdrtools
	  (<http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/cdrecord.html>)
	  and for burning a "disk at once": CDRDAO
	  (<http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/>). Cdparanoia is a high
	  quality digital reader of audio CDs (<http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/>).
	  For other devices, it's possible that you'll have to write the
	  driver software yourself. Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi-generic.txt> for more information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read

	  don't need this for those tiny 6-slot cdrom changers.  Media
	  changers are listed as "Type: Medium Changer" in /proc/scsi/scsi.
	  If you have such hardware and want to use it with linux, say Y

	help
	  Some devices support more than one LUN (Logical Unit Number) in order
	  to allow access to several media, e.g. CD jukebox, USB card reader,
	  mobile phone in mass storage mode. This option forces the kernel to
	  probe for all LUNs by default. This setting can be overriden by
	  max_luns boot/module parameter. Note that this option does not affect
	  devices conforming to SCSI-3 or higher as they can explicitely report
	  their number of LUNs. It is safe to say Y here unless you have one of
	  those rare devices which reacts in an unexpected way when probed for
	  multiple LUNs.

config SCSI_CONSTANTS
	bool "Verbose SCSI error reporting (kernel size +=12K)"
	depends on SCSI

	  understand if you say Y here; it will enlarge your kernel by about
	  12 KB. If in doubt, say Y.

config SCSI_LOGGING
	bool "SCSI logging facility"
	depends on SCSI
	---help---
	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
	  of SCSI related problems.

	  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
	  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo <bitmask> > /proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level

	  where <bitmask> is a four byte value representing the logging type
	  and logging level for each type of logging selected.

	  There are a number of logging types and you can find them in the
	  source at <file:drivers/scsi/scsi_logging.h>. The logging levels
	  are also described in that file and they determine the verbosity of
	  the logging for each logging type.

	  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
	  problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
	  there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
	  logging turned off.

config SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC
	bool "Asynchronous SCSI scanning"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  The SCSI subsystem can probe for devices while the rest of the
	  system continues booting, and even probe devices on different
	  busses in parallel, leading to a significant speed-up.

	  If you have built SCSI as modules, enabling this option can
	  be a problem as the devices may not have been found by the
	  time your system expects them to have been.  You can load the
	  scsi_wait_scan module to ensure that all scans have completed.
	  If you build your SCSI drivers into the kernel, then everything
	  will work fine if you say Y here.

	  You can override this choice by specifying "scsi_mod.scan=sync"
	  or async on the kernel's command line.

config SCSI_WAIT_SCAN
	tristate  # No prompt here, this is an invisible symbol.
	default m
	depends on SCSI
	depends on MODULES
# scsi_wait_scan is a loadable module which waits until all the async scans are
# complete.  The idea is to use it in initrd/ initramfs scripts.  You modprobe
# it after all the modprobes of the root SCSI drivers and it will wait until
# they have all finished scanning their buses before allowing the boot to
# proceed.  (This method is not applicable if targets boot independently in
# parallel with the initiator, or with transports with non-deterministic target
# discovery schemes, or if a transport driver does not support scsi_wait_scan.)
#
# This symbol is not exposed as a prompt because little is to be gained by
# disabling it, whereas people who accidentally switch it off may wonder why
# their mkinitrd gets into trouble.

	  WARNING This driver is an older aic7xxx driver and is no longer

	  take the place of this one, and it is recommended that whenever
	  possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
	  of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

	  This is support for the various aic7xxx based Adaptec SCSI
	  controllers. These include the 274x EISA cards; 284x VLB cards;
	  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and
	  motherboard based SCSI controllers from Adaptec. It does not support
	  the AAA-13x RAID controllers from Adaptec, nor will it likely ever
	  support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
	  use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you
	  need the "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" driver.

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller
	  chip from the aic777x series or the aic78xx series, this driver
	  should work. The only exception is the 7810 which is specifically
	  not supported (that's the RAID controller chip on the AAA-13x
	  cards).

	  Note that the AHA2920 SCSI host adapter is *not* supported by this
	  driver; choose "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" instead if you have
	  one of those.

	  Information on the configuration options for this controller can be
	  found by checking the help file for each of the available
	  configuration options. You should read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx_old.txt> at a minimum before
	  contacting the maintainer with any questions.  The SCSI-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, can also
	  be of great help.

	This driver supports all of Adaptec's Ultra 320 PCI-X
	based SCSI controllers.

config AIC79XX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE
	int "Maximum number of TCQ commands per device"
	depends on SCSI_AIC79XX
	default "32"
	---help---
	Specify the number of commands you would like to allocate per SCSI
	device when Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is enabled on that device.

	This is an upper bound value for the number of tagged transactions
	to be used for any device.  The aic7xxx driver will automatically
	vary this number based on device behavior.  For devices with a
	fixed maximum, the driver will eventually lock to this maximum
	and display a console message indicating this value.

	Due to resource allocation issues in the Linux SCSI mid-layer, using
	a high number of commands per device may result in memory allocation
	failures when many devices are attached to the system.  For this reason,
	the default is set to 32.  Higher values may result in higher performance
	on some devices.  The upper bound is 253.  0 disables tagged queueing.

	Per device tag depth can be controlled via the kernel command line
	"tag_info" option.  See drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/README.aic79xx
	for details.

	This option should only be enabled if you are modifying the firmware
	source to the aic79xx driver and wish to have the generated firmware
	include files updated during a normal kernel build.  The assembler
	for the firmware requires lex and yacc or their equivalents, as well
	as the db v1 library.  You may have to install additional packages
	or modify the assembler Makefile or the files it includes if your
	build environment is different than that of the author.

config IBMMCA_SCSI_ORDER_STANDARD

	  In the PC-world and in most modern SCSI-BIOS-setups, SCSI-hard disks
	  are assigned to the drive letters, starting with the lowest SCSI-id
	  (physical number -- pun) to be drive C:, as seen from DOS and
	  similar operating systems. When looking into papers describing the
	  ANSI-SCSI-standard, this assignment of drives appears to be wrong.
	  The SCSI-standard follows a hardware-hierarchy which says that id 7
	  has the highest priority and id 0 the lowest. Therefore, the host
	  adapters are still today everywhere placed as SCSI-id 7 by default.
	  In the SCSI-standard, the drive letters express the priority of the
	  disk. C: should be the hard disk, or a partition on it, with the
	  highest priority. This must therefore be the disk with the highest
	  SCSI-id (e.g. 6) and not the one with the lowest! IBM-BIOS kept the
	  original definition of the SCSI-standard as also industrial- and
	  process-control-machines, like VME-CPUs running under realtime-OSes
	  (e.g. LynxOS, OS9) do.

	  If you like to run Linux on your MCA-machine with the same
	  assignment of hard disks as seen from e.g. DOS or OS/2 on your
	  machine, which is in addition conformant to the SCSI-standard, you
	  must say Y here. This is also necessary for MCA-Linux users who want
	  to keep downward compatibility to older releases of the
	  IBM-MCA-SCSI-driver (older than driver-release 2.00 and older than
	  June 1997).

	  If you like to have the lowest SCSI-id assigned as drive C:, as
	  modern SCSI-BIOSes do, which does not conform to the standard, but
	  is widespread and common in the PC-world of today, you must say N

	  However, some devices exist, like special-control-devices,
	  SCSI-CNC-machines, SCSI-printer or scanners of older type, that do
	  not reset when switched on. If you say Y here, each device connected
	  to your SCSI-bus will be issued a reset-command after it has been
	  probed, while the kernel is booting. This may cause problems with
	  more modern devices, like hard disks, which do not appreciate these

	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use

	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless

	  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC
	int "synchronous transfers frequency in MHz"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "20"
	---help---
	  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
	  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

	  The default settings for the burst sizes are suitable for most PCI
	  chipsets. However, in some cases, large bursts may overrun buffers
	  in the PCI chipset and cause data corruption. In such cases, large
	  bursts must be disabled and only (slower) small bursts can be used.
	  The burst sizes can be set independently in the send (TX) and
	  receive (RX) direction.

	  Note that enabling many different burst sizes in the same direction
	  may increase the cost of setting up a transfer such that the
	  resulting throughput is lower than when using only the largest
	  available burst size.

	  Also, sometimes larger bursts lead to lower throughput, e.g. on an

	---help---
	  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a

	  local machines.  A PLIP link from a Linux box is a popular means to
	  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
	  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
	  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
	  enabled for this to work.

	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
	  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
	  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
	  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
	  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
	  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
	  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
	  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

	  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well
	  as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from

	  protocol has been changed and this PLIP driver won't work together
	  with the PLIP support in Linux versions 1.0.x.  This option enlarges
	  your kernel by about 8 KB.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called plip. If unsure, say Y or M, in case you buy
	  a laptop later.

config PPP
	tristate "PPP (point-to-point protocol) support"
	select SLHC
	---help---
	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
	  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
	  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
	  synchronous PPP", below.

	  If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
	  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
	  compile it as a module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M
	  here. The module will be called ppp_generic.

config PPP_MULTILINK
	bool "PPP multilink support (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	help
	  PPP multilink is a protocol (defined in RFC 1990) which allows you
	  to combine several (logical or physical) lines into one logical PPP
	  connection, so that you can utilize your full bandwidth.

	  This has to be supported at the other end as well and you need a
	  version of the pppd daemon which understands the multilink protocol.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPP_FILTER

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to filter the packets passing over
	  PPP interfaces.  This allows you to control which packets count as
	  activity (i.e. which packets will reset the idle timer or bring up
	  a demand-dialed link) and which packets are to be dropped entirely.
	  You need to say Y here if you wish to use the pass-filter and

	---help---
	  Support for the Deflate compression method for PPP, which uses the
	  Deflate algorithm (the same algorithm that gzip uses) to compress
	  each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire.  The machine at the
	  other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the
	  Deflate compression method as well for this to be useful.  Even if
	  they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config PPP_BSDCOMP
	tristate "PPP BSD-Compress compression"
	depends on PPP
	---help---
	  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses
	  the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is
	  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link
	  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression
	  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
	  it is safe to say Y here.

	  The PPP Deflate compression method ("PPP Deflate compression",
	  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better
	  and is patent-free.

	  Note that the BSD compression code will always be compiled as a
	  module; it is called bsd_comp and will show up in the directory
	  modules once you have said "make modules". If unsure, say N.

	  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
	  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
	  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
	  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
	  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
	  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
	  purpose.

	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
	  around (available from

	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with

	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for

	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was

	  and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
	  nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

	  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
	  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
	  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
	  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
	  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
	  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
	  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
	  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

	  On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need
	  to be selected.

	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  on-line as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt> in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

	  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to
	  connect graphics cards to the rest of the system.

	  If you have an AGP system and you say Y here, it will be possible to
	  use the AGP features of your 3D rendering video card. This code acts
	  as a sort of "AGP driver" for the motherboard's chipset.

	  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
	  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB
	  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses
	  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.

	  Note that this is the only means to have X/GLX use
	  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL
	  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called agpgart.

	  You should say Y here if you want to use GLX or DRI.

	help
	  Choose this option if you want kernel modesetting enabled by default.

	  This is a completely new driver. It's only part of the existing drm
	  for compatibility reasons. It requires an entirely different graphics
	  stack above it and works very differently from the old drm stack.
	  i.e. don't enable this unless you know what you are doing it may
	  cause issues or bugs compared to the previous userspace driver stack.

	  When kernel modesetting is enabled the IOCTL of radeon/drm
	  driver are considered as invalid and an error message is printed
	  in the log and they return failure.

	  KMS enabled userspace will use new API to talk with the radeon/drm
	  driver. The new API provide functions to create/destroy/share/mmap
	  buffer object which are then managed by the kernel memory manager
	  (here TTM). In order to submit command to the GPU the userspace
	  provide a buffer holding the command stream, along this buffer
	  userspace have to provide a list of buffer object used by the
	  command stream. The kernel radeon driver will then place buffer
	  in GPU accessible memory and will update command stream to reflect
	  the position of the different buffers.

	  The kernel will also perform security check on command stream
	  provided by the user, we want to catch and forbid any illegal use
	  of the GPU such as DMA into random system memory or into memory
	  not owned by the process supplying the command stream. This part
	  of the code is still incomplete and this why we propose that patch
	  as a staging driver addition, future security might forbid current
	  experimental userspace to run.

	  This code support the following hardware : R1XX,R2XX,R3XX,R4XX,R5XX
	  (radeon up to X1950). Works is underway to provide support for R6XX,
	  R7XX and newer hardware (radeon from HD2XXX to HD4XXX).

	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.munted.org.uk/programming/Framebuffer-HOWTO-1.3.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

	 parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	 For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	 an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	 rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	 terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	 This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If
	 unsure, say N.

	  value, a nonnegative integer that specifies how many
	  seconds of idle time the driver must count before it may
	  put the AC97 into power-save mode;  a value of 0 (zero)
	  disables the use of this power-save mode.

	  In this case, the time-out is set to 10 seconds; setting
	  the time-out to 1 second (the minimum activation value)
	  isn't recommended because many applications try to reopen

	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.
	  
	  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the
	  leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs.
	  Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals
	  such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks,
	  flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.

	  Say Y here if your computer has a host-side USB port and you want
	  to use USB devices.  You then need to say Y to at least one of the
	  Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1
	  controller, such as "UHCI HCD support" or "OHCI HCD support",
	  and "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" except for older systems that
	  do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select
	  them all if you are not certain.

	  If your system has a device-side USB port, used in the peripheral
	  side of the USB protocol, see the "USB Gadget" framework instead.

	  After choosing your HCD, then select drivers for the USB peripherals
	  you'll be using.  You may want to check out the information provided
	  in <file:Documentation/usb/> and especially the links given in
	  <file:Documentation/usb/usb-help.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbcore.

	  If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File

	  which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
	  busses, and for every connected device a file named
	  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
	  device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
	  to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
	  they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

	  You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
	  mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

	  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
	  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

	  Modern Linux systems do not use this.

	  Usbfs entries are files and not character devices; usbfs can't
	  handle Access Control Lists (ACL) which are the default way to
	  grant access to USB devices for untrusted users of a desktop
	  system.

	  The usbfs functionality is replaced by real device-nodes managed by
	  udev.  These nodes lived in /dev/bus/usb and are used by libusb.

config USB_DEVICE_CLASS

	---help---
	  Userspace access to USB devices is granted by device-nodes exported
	  directly from the usbdev in sysfs. Old versions of the driver
	  core and udev needed additional class devices to export device nodes.

	  These additional devices are difficult to handle in userspace, if
	  information about USB interfaces must be available. One device
	  contains the device node, the other device contains the interface
	  data. Both devices are at the same level in sysfs (siblings) and one
	  can't access the other. The device node created directly by the
	  usb device is the parent device of the interface and therefore
	  easily accessible from the interface event.

	  This option provides backward compatibility for libusb device

	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	  Most LCDs use a standard controller which supports hardware lines of 40

	  to the terminal. This results in some non-visible but addressable characters,
	  and is the case for most parallel LCDs. Other LCDs, and some serial ones,
	  however, use the same line width internally as what is visible. The KS0074
	  for example, uses 16 characters per line for 16 visible characters per line.

	  This option lets you configure the value used by your LCD in 'custom' profile.

	  Most LCDs use a single address bit to differentiate line 0 and line 1. Since
	  some of them need to be able to address 40 chars with the lower bits, they
	  often use the immediately superior power of 2, which is 64, to address the

	  This driver now supports any serial or parallel LCD wired to a parallel

	  SMB (Server Message Block) is the protocol Windows for Workgroups

	  access them just like any other Unix directory.  Currently, this
	  works only if the Windows machines use TCP/IP as the underlying
	  transport protocol, and not NetBEUI.  For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt> and the SMB-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note: if you just want your box to act as an SMB *server* and make

	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access

	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called ext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create ext3 journals

	  XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
	  on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
	  support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
	  variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
	  Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
	  and scalability.

	  Refer to the documentation at <http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/>
	  for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible
	  with the IRIX version of XFS.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the

	  for conversion.

	  If unsure, say N.  More comprehensive documentation can be found in

	  for media streaming applications, but is also useful as a generic
	  mechanism for ensuring data and metadata/log I/Os are completely
	  separated.  Regular file I/Os are isolated to a separate device
	  from all other requests, and this can be done quite transparently

	  VFAT (Windows 95) file systems), then you must say Y or M here
	  to include FAT support. You will then be able to mount partitions or
	  diskettes with FAT-based file systems and transparently access the
	  files on them, i.e. MSDOS files will look and behave just like all
	  other Unix files.

	  This FAT support is not a file system in itself, it only provides
	  the foundation for the other file systems. You will have to say Y or
	  M to at least one of "MSDOS fs support" or "VFAT fs support" in
	  order to make use of it.

	  Another way to read and write MSDOS floppies and hard drive
	  partitions from within Linux (but not transparently) is with the
	  mtools ("man mtools") program suite. You don't need to say Y here in
	  order to do that.

	  If you need to move large files on floppies between a DOS and a
	  Linux box, say Y here, mount the floppy under Linux with an MSDOS
	  file system and use GNU tar's M option. GNU tar is a program
	  available for Unix and DOS ("man tar" or "info tar").

	  The FAT support will enlarge your kernel by about 37 KB. If unsure,
	  say Y.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  fat.  Note that if you compile the FAT support as a module, you
	  cannot compile any of the FAT-based file systems into the kernel
	  -- they will have to be modules as well.

	  so you may find that some very small files (<500 bytes or so) cannot
	  be written to.

	  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have
	  so far not received a single report where the driver would have
	  damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.

	  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from

	  which results in the code/data being placed in specific sections.
	  The section mismatch analysis is always done after a full

	  - Add the option -fno-inline-functions-called-once to gcc
	    When inlining a function annotated __init in a non-init
	    function we would lose the section information and thus
	    the analysis would not catch the illegal reference.

	    lose valueble information about where the mismatch was

	 This feature enables the kernel to prove that all locking
	 that occurs in the kernel runtime is mathematically
	 correct: that under no circumstance could an arbitrary (and
	 not yet triggered) combination of observed locking
	 sequences (on an arbitrary number of CPUs, running an
	 arbitrary number of tasks and interrupt contexts) cause a
	 deadlock.

	 In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking
	 related deadlocks before they actually occur.

	 The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a
	 deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many
	 participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed
	 for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on
	 timing: if a race and a resulting deadlock is possible
	 theoretically (no matter how unlikely the race scenario
	 is), it will be proven so and will immediately be
	 reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that
	 makes the deadlock theoretically possible).

	 If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as
	 observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the
	 kernel reports nothing.

	 NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes
	 and rwsems - in which case all dependencies between these
	 different locking variants are observed and mapped too, and
	 the proof of observed correctness is also maintained for an
	 arbitrary combination of these separate locking variants.

	help
	  If you want to debug problems which hang or crash the kernel early
	  on boot and the crashing machine has a FireWire port, you can use
	  this feature to remotely access the memory of the crashed machine
	  over FireWire. This employs remote DMA as part of the OHCI1394
	  specification which is now the standard for FireWire controllers.

	  With remote DMA, you can monitor the printk buffer remotely using
	  firescope and access all memory below 4GB using fireproxy from gdb.
	  Even controlling a kernel debugger is possible using remote DMA.

	  Usage:

	  If ohci1394_dma=early is used as boot parameter, it will initialize
	  all OHCI1394 controllers which are found in the PCI config space.

	  As all changes to the FireWire bus such as enabling and disabling
	  devices cause a bus reset and thereby disable remote DMA for all
	  devices, be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on
	  the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.

	  This code (~1k) is freed after boot. By then, the firewire stack
	  in charge of the OHCI-1394 controllers should be used instead.

	  Compiles debug level messages into the kernel, which would not
	  otherwise be available at runtime. These messages can then be
	  enabled/disabled based on various levels of scope - per source file,
	  function, module, format string, and line number. This mechanism
	  implicitly enables all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls. The impact of
	  this compile option is a larger kernel text size of about 2%.

	  Usage:

	  Dynamic debugging is controlled via the 'dynamic_debug/control' file,
	  which is contained in the 'debugfs' filesystem. Thus, the debugfs
	  filesystem must first be mounted before making use of this feature.
	  We refer the control file as: <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control. This
	  file contains a list of the debug statements that can be enabled. The
	  format for each line of the file is:

		filename:lineno [module]function flags format

	  filename : source file of the debug statement
	  lineno : line number of the debug statement
	  module : module that contains the debug statement
	  function : function that contains the debug statement
          flags : 'p' means the line is turned 'on' for printing
          format : the format used for the debug statement

	  From a live system:

		nullarbor:~ # cat <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control
		# filename:lineno [module]function flags format
		fs/aio.c:222 [aio]__put_ioctx - "__put_ioctx:\040freeing\040%p\012"
		fs/aio.c:248 [aio]ioctx_alloc - "ENOMEM:\040nr_events\040too\040high\012"
